# PrabhjotBookStore

On November 04, 2023, at 11:23, I launched the "PrabhjotBookStore" MVC project. In Step 1.1 (Review), I set up the Git repository, implemented individual account type authentication, and created the project using the C# language and web platform (version 5.0). I tested the program successfully, made the required modifications, and uploaded the updated files to GitHub.

At 11:30, I proceeded to Step 1.2 (Debugging) and ensured that the project was functioning properly. I verified that the application performed just as it should.
