# PrabhjotBookStore

On November 04, 2023, at 11:23, I launched the "PrabhjotBookStore" MVC project. In Step 1.1 (Review), I set up the Git repository, implemented individual account type authentication, and created the project using the C# language and web platform (version 5.0). I tested the program successfully, made the required modifications, and uploaded the updated files to GitHub.

At 11:30, I proceeded to Step 1.2 (Debugging) and ensured that the project was functioning properly. I verified that the application performed just as it should.

In Step 1.3 Bootstrap, executed on October 31, 2023, at 11:32 AM, significant improvements were made to the website's appearance and functionality. Original Bootstrap files were renamed, new files were added, and CSS files were updated to create a visually appealing interface. The navbar was transformed to dark, and background colors were changed, enhancing the site's aesthetics. Additional styles and scripts were integrated, ensuring a consistent layout. Interactive elements, including a dropdown menu, were added to enhance user navigation. These changes were thoroughly tested and successfully implemented, providing users with an improved and seamless browsing experience. The modifications were committed to Github, completing Step 1.3 Bootstrap.

In Step 1.4, initiated on November 4, 2023, at 11:45 AM and successfully completed by 1:00 AM, significant enhancements were implemented within the project. New projects, namely PrabhjotBooks.DataAccess, PrabhjotBooks.Models, and PrabhjotBooks.Utility, were added. The data folder was relocated from PrabhjotBooks.DataAccess to PrabhjotBookStore for better organization. Essential packages such as Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational and Core.SqlServer were installed, optimizing database functionality. Additionally, Identity.EntityFrameworkCore was integrated, reinforcing security measures. A pivotal move involved renaming the Model folder to ViewModel within the PrabhjotSinghBooks.Models project. Troubleshooting was vital during this process, with issues arising in namespace declarations and view setups. After meticulous adjustments, including the addition of necessary references, modifications to route configurations, and folder restructuring, the tasks were successfully validated, resulting in a more refined and efficient project structure by the completion of Step 1.4 at 1:00 AM.
