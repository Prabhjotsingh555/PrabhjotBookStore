# PrabhjotBookStore

PART 1

On November 04, 2023, at 11:23, I launched the "PrabhjotBookStore" MVC project. In Step 1.1 (Review), I set up the Git repository, implemented individual account type authentication, and created the project using the C# language and web platform (version 5.0). I tested the program successfully, made the required modifications, and uploaded the updated files to GitHub.

At 11:30, I proceeded to Step 1.2 (Debugging) and ensured that the project was functioning properly. I verified that the application performed just as it should.

In Step 1.3 Bootstrap, executed on October 31, 2023, at 11:32 AM, significant improvements were made to the website's appearance and functionality. Original Bootstrap files were renamed, new files were added, and CSS files were updated to create a visually appealing interface. The navbar was transformed to dark, and background colors were changed, enhancing the site's aesthetics. Additional styles and scripts were integrated, ensuring a consistent layout. Interactive elements, including a dropdown menu, were added to enhance user navigation. These changes were thoroughly tested and successfully implemented, providing users with an improved and seamless browsing experience. The modifications were committed to Github, completing Step 1.3 Bootstrap.

In Step 1.4, initiated on November 4, 2023, at 11:45 AM and successfully completed by 1:00 AM, significant enhancements were implemented within the project. New projects, namely PrabhjotBooks.DataAccess, PrabhjotBooks.Models, and PrabhjotBooks.Utility, were added. The data folder was relocated from PrabhjotBooks.DataAccess to PrabhjotBookStore for better organization. Essential packages such as Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational and Core.SqlServer were installed, optimizing database functionality. Additionally, Identity.EntityFrameworkCore was integrated, reinforcing security measures. A pivotal move involved renaming the Model folder to ViewModel within the PrabhjotSinghBooks.Models project. Troubleshooting was vital during this process, with issues arising in namespace declarations and view setups. After meticulous adjustments, including the addition of necessary references, modifications to route configurations, and folder restructuring, the tasks were successfully validated, resulting in a more refined and efficient project structure by the completion of Step 1.4 at 1:00 AM.

In Step 2.1, initiated at 01:07 AM on November 4, 2023, essential database configurations were executed. The appsetting.json file was appropriately updated to reflect the necessary settings. Initial attempts to add a migration encountered errors due to the incorrect project selection, which was promptly rectified, enabling a successful migration. The migration entry, identified as 20231104171407_DefaultIdentityMigration.cs, was created. To add a new Category entity to the database, a Category.cs class was introduced in PrabhjotBooks.Models, and subsequent modifications were made. A migration named CategoryToDb was added, but an error occurred due to an existing migration using the same name. This was resolved by deleting the previous CategoryToDb migration file and re-running the command, resulting in a successful database update and validation of the process.

In Step 2.2 Repository, starting on November 6, 2023, at 04:39 AM, crucial repository-related tasks were accomplished. New folders and classes were added and meticulously modified within PrabhjotBooks.DataAccess, ensuring seamless data interaction. Challenges arose during the configuration of services in the startup.cs file, specifically related to the IUnitOfWork interface. By refining accessibility and references, these issues were resolved, enabling successful integration. Thorough testing validated the changes, which included the addition of IRepository, Repository, ICategoryRepository, and CategoryRepository classes, as well as ISP_Call and SP_Call interfaces, and the implementation of the UnitOfWork class. These enhancements enhance the project's repository structure, establishing a robust foundation for efficient data management and interaction. The completed modifications were committed to Github, marking the successful conclusion of Step 2.2 Repository.

In Step 2.3 Category CRUD, a series of actions were executed to enable efficient management of categories within the project. The process commenced with the addition of a new controller, CategoryControllers, within the Admin's Controllers directory, followed by meticulous modifications to this file for functionality enhancement. Visual components were improved by adding a new folder named 'category' in the Admin's View, where a new view, Index.cshtml, was introduced and further refined. Integrative efforts included adding category options to the content-management dropdown menu, incorporating icons in the Index.cshtml file, and enhancing user interaction by introducing Delete and View buttons. Additional functionalities were added through the creation of razor views like Upsert, _CreateAndBackToListButton, and _EditAndBackToListButton within the Admin's Category directory. These components were carefully modified to ensure seamless user experience. Furthermore, enhancements were made to the _layoutschtml file for a consistent layout. The integration of JavaScript functions for delete operations was executed, accompanied by updates to relevant documentation. Rigorous testing validated the changes, and upon successful validation, the modifications were committed to Github, marking the completion of Step 2.3 Category CRUD.

In Step 2.3 and 2.4 **Step 3.2 Product CRUD 3 Between November 16 and December 4, 2023, the implementation of Product CRUD functionality underwent a series of refinements and troubleshooting. Initiating with the integration of the Upsert view and subsequent modifications, the development journey encountered challenges during attempts to run the program on different machines. Meticulous handling of migrations, coupled with code adjustments, resolved database update errors. The middle phase involved enhancements to user interface styling and systematic resolution of errors in product creation and updates. The introduction of a detail view in Customer > Views > Home, along with associated controller modifications, contributed to an improved user experience. Challenges in database updates were tactically addressed, leading to the successful resolution of issues. The final stage witnessed the identification and manual rectification of a database update error related to an existing product name table. The completion of Step 3.2 Product CRUD 3 and 3.4 marked a milestone, with all changes duly committed to GitHub.
