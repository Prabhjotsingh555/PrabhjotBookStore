# PrabhjotBookStore

On November 04, 2023, at 11:23, I launched the "PrabhjotBookStore" MVC project. In Step 1.1 (Review), I set up the Git repository, implemented individual account type authentication, and created the project using the C# language and web platform (version 5.0). I tested the program successfully, made the required modifications, and uploaded the updated files to GitHub.

At 11:30, I proceeded to Step 1.2 (Debugging) and ensured that the project was functioning properly. I verified that the application performed just as it should.

In Step 1.3 Bootstrap, executed on October 31, 2023, at 11:32 AM, significant improvements were made to the website's appearance and functionality. Original Bootstrap files were renamed, new files were added, and CSS files were updated to create a visually appealing interface. The navbar was transformed to dark, and background colors were changed, enhancing the site's aesthetics. Additional styles and scripts were integrated, ensuring a consistent layout. Interactive elements, including a dropdown menu, were added to enhance user navigation. These changes were thoroughly tested and successfully implemented, providing users with an improved and seamless browsing experience. The modifications were committed to Github, completing Step 1.3 Bootstrap.
